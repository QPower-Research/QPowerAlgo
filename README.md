## Overview

The goal of this project is to have in a single place all possible quantum algorithms and programs - in multiple available frameworks. We aim to achieve this collaboratively, so feel free to contribute in any way you want, just make sure to follow the contribution guidelines listed below.

In case you have any questions, feel free to tag one of the repo admins in your issue/PR (**don't assign us to any issue!**): Syed Farhan(@born-2learn), Ricardo Prins(@ricardoprins).

## Contents

Our content is divided by quantum computing frameworks. Please create an issue if you wish to add code in a framework that we don't currently have here. **Do not create folders in your submissions, unless specifically told to do so.**

Also, we are accepting submissions to our [Wiki](https://github.com/QPower-Research/QPowerAlgo/wiki) section. Please let us know if you'd like to contribute to an article.

- [Qiskit](/qiskit/README.md)
- [Q#](/qsharp/README.md)
- [Cirq](/cirq/README.md)
- [Pennylane](/pennylane/README.md)
- [Strawberry Fields](/strawberryfields/README.md)
- [Miscellaneous](/Miscellaneous/README.md)

## Contributing Guidelines

- Issues will be assigned on a _first come, first serve_ basis. You just have to comment on the issue, asking to be assigned, and it will be done if found fit.
- Preferably, you cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you.
- In case you want to submit an improvement to an existing algorithm, we prefer that you create an issue, describing in details your improvement. This will help others to analyze your contribution. You can use the [templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/algorithm-ds-proposal.md) that we have provided :)
- If you have anything else in mind, create an issue and please wait for it to be assigned to you. You can then start working on it and create a PR.
- All PRs must be made from a Branch. Create a separate branch for every Issue you are working upon and once found fit, make a PR.
- If you have no idea what are issues or PRs, please do refer to [this link](https://github.com/TesseractCoding/NeoAlgo/wiki/What-is-a-Pull-Request-and-how-to-do-it%3F)

Make sure your code works before submitting it :D

### Where to upload the files

**PLEASE READ THIS**

- Your files should be uploaded directly into the corresponding folder (e.g. if you wrote code for a Grover's Search with qiskit, it goes inside the Grover's Search folder within the qiskit folder and so on)
- Edit the corresponding _README.md_ file to **add the link to your code in the corresponding section** ([GitHub Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- **Under no circumstances create new folders within the language folders to upload your code unless specifically told to do so**.
- Also, be polite with the reviewers - they will be ALWAYS polite to you.
